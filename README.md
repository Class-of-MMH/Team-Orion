<h1>Pacman Game</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
Pacman Game in C is a basic console program or a little clip game created for amusement purposes. It is
similar to the snake game in that Pacman must be directed in such a manner that he advances down a
predetermined route before it is deleted or devoured by Pacman. The more you consume the dots, the more
points you get; the game is simple to play.

<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
Pacman's movement is controlled by W, S, A, D(up, down, left, and right) keys. Pacman's
movement is paused by using the space bar. You will be the winner if you can drive the Pacman along all of
the lines such that he consumes all the dots.

<h2>Development Goal:</h2>
The game's C files are used to control Pacman's velocity and direction, as well as to generate the route. The Pacman Game in C
demonstrates the usage of user-defined struct data structure and the use of pointers.
